For the pattpred training data generation

MONO/POLY AUD/SYM SMALL/MEDIUM

Unzip subdir_template.zip and move to appropriate directory of, e.g., ~/tomthecollins/Shizz/Lehigh/Projects/MIREX/2018/20180918/PPDD-Sep2018/

Randomly select subset of Lakh MIDI Dataset
E.g., run choosing_lakh_files_small.lisp in Clozure CL
Make sure the audio/symbolic and monophonic/polyphonic path files are defined appropriately (I did not bother remaking this script for each variant of those)

Generate prime/continuation CSV files
E.g., run
node generate_train/midi2prime_cont_mono_small.js -u 'tom'
at the Terminal. If making an aud variant, copy/paste corresponding files from the sym variant.

Convert CSV files to MIDI files
Run csv2midi_mono_small.lisp in Clozure CL
If making an aud variant, copy/paste corresponding files from the sym variant.

If making an aud variant, convert CSV files to WAV files
Run csv2wav_prime_cont_mono_small.m in Matlab

Compress and upload to Drive using regular Mac zip compression
Remove the orig_midi folder, compress again, and upload to tomcollinsresearch.net using FileZilla.


LARGE
Same as above, apart from (1) Lakh file selection is handled by the node script, and (2) compression is achieved using p7zip (https://www.mankier.com/1/7za), installed via "brew install p7zip on Mac". E.g., the script call is something like
7za a PPDD-Sep2018_sym_mono_large.zip PPDD-Sep2018_sym_mono_large
